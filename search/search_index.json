syndrome research and healthcare advancement. It provides a standardized framework for defining metadata related to Down syndrome research, promoting seamless data sharing and collaboration. About INCLUDE The INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) Project, launched in June 2018, supports critical health and quality-of-life needs for individuals with Down syndrome by investigating co-occurring conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease/dementia, autism, cataracts, celiac disease, congenital heart disease, and diabetes. About LinkML LinkML is a flexible modeling language that allows you to author schemas (\u201cmodels\u201d) in YAML, describing the structure of your data. Designed for both simple and complex use cases, LinkML facilitates the creation of interoperable and standard-compliant data models. Key Features Standardized Metadata: Ensures clarity, consistency, and interoperability across diverse datasets and research endeavors. Facilitated Collaboration: Promotes collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and stakeholders, accelerating research progress. Accessible Data Hub: Provides easy access to valuable resources, datasets, and insights through the Data Hub. Targeted Basic Science Studies: Focuses on high-risk, high-reward research on chromosome 21 to better understand Down syndrome biology and develop new treatments. Large Cohort Assembly: Connects existing cohorts and enrolls new participants to study the full range of conditions experienced by individuals with Down syndrome across their lifespan. Inclusive Clinical Trials: Identifies and supports clinical trials addressing conditions common in the Down syndrome population, establishing measures specific to Down syndrome for evaluating clinical success. How LinkML Enhances the Model Flexible Data Modeling: LinkML supports a range of data structures, from simple spreadsheets to complex interlinked schemas, enabling comprehensive and adaptable metadata descriptions. Interoperability: Designed to work with semantic frameworks like RDF and familiar developer frameworks like JSON, ensuring that data models are widely accessible and usable across different platforms and applications. Human-Readable Syntax: Utilizing YAML for schema definitions, LinkML offers an approachable syntax for both technical and non-technical users, promoting broader participation in schema development. Integration Capabilities: LinkML's compatibility with various data standards and technologies facilitates seamless integration with existing systems and data sources, enhancing data utility and research outcomes. How to Get Involved Explore the Model: Gain a deeper understanding of essential metadata elements for Down syndrome research. Collaborate: Join forces to leverage the INCLUDE LinkML Model and accelerate progress. Contribute: Share expertise, insights, and data to enrich the model and shape the future of Down syndrome research. Start Exploring Visit INCLUDE Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to access the INCLUDE LinkML Model and join the collaborative effort toward transforming Down syndrome research and healthcare.
