# Example data for include_linkml_data_model

This folder contains example data for testing and demonstrating the datamodel`
sorted in subfolders:

- `valid` for data conforming to the datamodel. Used to verify the datamodel.
- `invalid` for data not conforming to the datamodel. Used to verify the validation.
- `problem` for data which are not yet handled correctly in the current schema version,
   again separated into valid/invalid.

The filenames of all example data must conform to the scheme `classname-###.yaml`
where classname must be a the name of a class from the schema. "###" can be a number
or one or more other characters allowed in filenames. The classname is derived by
splitting at the first "-" and taking the part before the "-".
