# Slot Usage Overview
# ====================
# This section outlines the use of various slots (fields) across different entity classes,
# including how slots can be customized or referenced within specific classes.
# Slot usage enables fine-grained control over how each slot behaves within the context of each class.

# Slot Usage: Directly Assigned to Entity Classes
# -------------------------------------------------------
# These slots are associated with specific classes, defining essential attributes for each entity.
#
# - dataCategory: Used in Study, Dataset, DataFile
# - dbgap: Used in Study, Dataset
# - publication: Used in Study, Dataset
# - expectedNumberOfParticipant: Used in Study, Dataset
# - dataType: Used in DataFile, Dataset
# - experimentalStrategy: Used in DataFile, Dataset
# - studyCode: Used in Participant
# - participantExternalId: Used in Participant

# Referential Slot Usage: Cross-Class References
# ------------------------------------------------
# These slots are used in multiple classes to establish relationships and link data across entities.
# They do not define new slots but rather adapt existing slots for use in multiple contexts.
#
# - studyCode: Referenced in Participant, Condition, Biospecimen, DataFile, Dataset, DatasetManifest
# - participantGlobalId: Referenced in Condition, Biospecimen, DataFile
# - eventId: (Usage not fully defined, consider adding specific references)
# - sampleGlobalId: Referenced in DataFile, DatasetManifest
# - fileGlobalId: Referenced in DatasetManifest
